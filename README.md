## Installation:

### First things first, some info...

This is a full-stack repository that contains both the client and server code.

You can run both the client and the server code locally. For deployment, I recommend using a cloud service like Vercel for the client and Heroku or a VPS for the server. The current deployment of this application is as follows:

- Client: Vercel
- Server: Ubuntu 20.04 VPS (Nginx, Uvicorn, SystemD)

### Prerequisites

#### Client

##### Environment Variables

1. YOUTUBE_API_KEY: You will need to create a YouTube API key and set it as an environment variable. You can do this by creating a .env file in the root of the project and adding the following line:

2. OPENAI_API_KEY: You will need to create an OpenAI API key and set it as an environment variable. You can do this by creating a .env file in the root of the project and adding the following line:

3. SERVER_URL: You will need to set the server url as an environment variable. You can do this by creating a .env file in the root of the project and adding the following line:

```bash
SERVER_URL=YOUR_SERVER_URL (e.g. http://localhost:8000)
```

#### Server

1. A way to run Python code (e.g. a VPS, Heroku, etc.)
2. A way to run FastAPI (e.g. Uvicorn, Gunicorn, etc.)
3. A way to proxy requests to the FastAPI server (e.g. Nginx, Caddy, etc.)

## Getting Started:

## Running client

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/engageintellect/stonk-ai.git
cd stonk-ai/client
```

2. Create a .env (or .env.local) file in the root of the project and add the following line:

```bash
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
SERVER_URL=YOUR_SERVER_URL
```

3. Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Run the development server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Client

#### Build client

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Server

1. Navigate to the server directory

```bash
cd stonk-ai/server
```

2. Create a new Python virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the server code

```
python3 main.py
```

**NOTE:** Take note of the server URL. You will need it to set the SERVER_URL environment variable in the client.

#### Logs

server logs can be found in `/stonk-ai/server/log.txt`.
