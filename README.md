# Sentiment News
Sentiment News is a web app dedicated to exploring the relationship between financial news article sentiment and the price action of related stocks. The goal of this project was to quantify how positive or negative sentiment in news articles can influence stock price fluctuations. For example, when a news article about a company's success is published, the stock price of that company is expected to increase. This app creates insights into this phenomenon by analyzing news article sentiment and correlating it with stock price changes.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
